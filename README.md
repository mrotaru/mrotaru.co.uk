WIP:
- completely static html/css - simple website, frameworks not needed; plus, works on IE and without JS
- check caching headers generated by S3/Cloudfront, add content hashing (css, etc) if needed
- use some js for progressive enhancement
- pre-fetch on post link hover
- use service worker for caching
